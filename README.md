# Machine Learning and Weather Prediction with ClimateWins

## Introduction

This repository contains the datasets, Python Scripts and analysis performed throughout the second achievement of CareerFoundry's Specialization course in Machine Learning. 

## Project Background

This project was designed to use machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate change. ClimateWins (a fictitious non-profit organization created for this project) is concerned about the increase in extreme weather events, particularly in the last 10 to 20 years. Believing that weather extremes coud be predicted and planned for using advanced tools such as machine learning. With data from the past century, it hopes to create a model for what the future will hold. 

## Data Source

Although ClimateWins is fictitious, the data used for this project is real, and consists of weather observations from 18 weather stations across Europe, spanning the late 1800s to 2022. The data is collected by the [European Climate Assessment & Data Set Project](https://www.ecad.eu).
